## Overview

DigitalBrain is already a durable neuron graph: typed `IHandle<T>`, source-owned synapses, broadcast-once journals, out-of-silo C# behaviors, and entities (Chart, Surface, Memory) that the UI mounts. What still fights that model is **boot composition**. `BrainGraphProjection` seeds `IChat` + Ino + the owner session so `/chats/{name}/brain` has something to draw. `Chat` is a mini-app: `SendMessage` → turn queue → `ChatTurnWorker` → `IAgentKernel.AskStreaming` on the **same grain** as `IAssistant`. `IAssistant` cannot receive `UserMessaged`. `start.cs` is a no-op string run by `StartupScriptWorker` (not an `IBehavior`). Flutter windowing is an offline playground.

The change: **`start.cs` (StartupScriptWorker only) is the OS of this brain**. That script writes the Bound synapse **inbox → Ino** for `UserMessaged`. The UI never composes the graph. It injects typed facts (`UserMessaged`) into one owner-global composer and mounts entities (Transcript, Surface, Chart, Memory). A workspace is a **view** (stored `CorrelationId` + bounded transcript + surface scenes) over the **same** Ino and the same durable behaviors — not a new assistant neuron.

`IAgentKernel` is extracted off Ino’s neuron grain so overlapping `UserMessaged` can enqueue instead of blocking behind the stream. `start.cs` Subscribe lands in the **same production switch** that stops Chat bind/broadcast — never earlier.

---

## Background & Motivation

### Current boot path (verified)

`start.cs` is **`StartupScriptWorker` only**. It is never saved as an `IBehavior`, never claimed by `BehaviorExecutionWorker`, and its hash ledger is not a behavior revision.

1. Aspire `AddDigitalBrainClient(..., activateOnStart: true)` registers `DigitalBrainActivationHostedService` (`src/Aspire/DigitalBrain.Aspire/DigitalBrainClientHostingExtensions.cs`).
2. `StartAsync` → `IDigitalBrain.ActivateAsync` → `BrainNeuron.Activate` (`src/Kernel/DigitalBrain/Neuron/BrainNeuron.cs`).
3. First activation journals `DigitalBrainActivated` on the owner root (`GrainTypeName = "sessionneuron"`, instance `"session"`) and publishes that delivery on the activation `BroadcastChannel`. Subsequent `Activate` calls no-op via `_activationPublished`.
4. Scripting host (`src/Kernel/DigitalBrain.Scripting/Program.cs`) connects with `activateOnStart: false`, watches owner-root **outgoing** for `DigitalBrainActivated` (`DigitalBrainActivationSource`), then runs `scripts/start.cs` through `CSharpStartupScriptRunner`.
5. Ledger key is `(owner, activationSignalId, scriptSha256)` (`FileStartupExecutionLedger`). Composition commands are not replayed for the same triple. A **changed** `start.cs` (new hash) will run again against the historical activation if the scripting host re-reads the journal — so `start.cs` must be idempotent (`SubscribeTo` / `Bind` already is).
6. `start.cs` today:

```csharp
return $"DigitalBrain owner '{Brain.Owner.Value}' startup behavior completed.";
```

That is not an OS. Nothing is wired. The return string’s word “behavior” is leftover naming, not `IBehavior`.

### What the graph plants instead

`BrainGraphProjection.ReadAsync` (`src/Kernel/DigitalBrain.Silo/BrainGraphProjection.cs`) **seeds** participants before walking synapses:

```csharp
var chat = NeuronId.For<IChat>(source.Owner, PrincipalScoped.InstanceName(actor.PrincipalId, chatName));
var ownerRoot = IBrainNeuron.ForOwner(source.Owner);
var participants = new HashSet<NeuronId>
{
    chat,
    new("assistant", source.Owner, "assistant"),
    ownerRoot,
};
// plus Discover(behavior) for every saved IBehavior
```

Then it BFS-walks outgoing synapses, journals, and `AgentActivity` delegations.

**`isInfrastructure` today (code):** `chat-turn-worker` | `sessionneuron` | `behaviors` | `execution` only (`BrainGraphProjection` node construction). `surface-boot` and `uirenderer` are **not** flagged; they appear only if discovered. Flutter `studioCanvas` (`graph_home_screen.dart`) hides `isInfrastructure` and `role == library`, and hides `chat` unless it already has a synapse to a non-assistant, non-infra node. Tests: `src/Modules/UI/Flutter/shell/test/behavior_studio_test.dart`.

The debugger **creates** the conversation citizen (`IChat` grain identity is touched by the seed `ReadActiveExecutionAsync(chat)`) in order to draw `/chats/{name}/brain`. That is the opposite of “graph is a debugger, not a seed list.”

Walk rules that matter later: Bound synapses live on the **source**. Discover-from-`Subscribe` journal entries runs only when `privateNeuron` is true. Shared (non-partitioned) neurons require `delivery.Principal == principal` in `VisibleDelivery`, so a `Subscribe` recorded with `Principal is null` (startup script, no actor) is invisible on Ino.

### What chat does today (the orchestrator to unwind)

`IChat` (`src/Modules/UI/DigitalBrain.Modules.UI.Contracts/Chat/IChat.cs`) handles `SendMessage`, `CancelTurn`, `ReadTranscriptRequest`, turn snapshots, execution focus, `CompleteUserAction`, notes, ui cards.

On activate, `Chat.OnNeuronActivatedAsync` **binds** a Bound synapse from this chat to a principal-partitioned `IUserMessages` named `"default"` (`BindOutgoing(inbox, nameof(UserMessaged))`). `EnqueueTurnAsync` then:

1. `RememberOwnerTurnAsync` appends the owner turn to a durable `_transcript` list (64 turns) and `BroadcastAsync(new UserMessaged(...), ConversationCorrelation)`.
2. Enqueues a `DurableTurnRecord` and starts `ChatTurnWorker.RunAsync`.
3. Worker loads `IChatKernel.LoadTranscript` / `LoadActiveExecution`, builds MEAI messages, and calls `IAgentKernel.AskStreaming` on `NeuronId.For<IAssistant>(owner, "assistant")` (`ChatTurnWorker.DefaultResponder`).
4. Chat journals `Responded` / `TurnLifecycle` on **its** outgoing feed. The worker returns `ChatTurnResult`; it does not `RecordOutgoing` on Ino. HTTP SSE (`ChatTurnStream`, `OwnerSessionJournal.WatchChatOutgoingAsync`) watches Chat.

`IAssistant : IAgent : IHandle<AgentRequest>` only (`src/Modules/AI/Contracts/IAssistant.cs`). `Agent : Neuron, IAgent, IAgentKernel` (`Agent.cs`). `NeuronConcurrency.RequireSerializedTurns` forbids `[Reentrant]` / `[MayInterleave]`. `AskStreaming` therefore holds **Ino’s** activation for the whole LLM + tool loop. That is fine today because **Chat** enqueues on a different grain. It is not fine once Ino `IHandle`s `UserMessaged` on that same grain.

`IUserMessages` (`Alias("usermessages")`) already `IHandle<UserMessaged>` and rebroadcasts (`UserMessagesNeuron`). Chat is the wrong **source**.

`DigitalBrainClientTransport.GetReference` principal-scopes **every** neuron when `_claim` or `_connectionActor` is set, except `IBehaviors`. `IAssistant` is not excepted. MCP `GraphTools.Instance` always `PrincipalPartition.InstanceName(Operator, name)` for `kind: usermessages`.

`NeuronReference.SendAsync` / `INeuronGrain.SendFrom` take `(receiver, signal)` only. `SignalDelivery.Create` does `correlation ?? cause?.CorrelationId ?? CorrelationId.New()`. Session inject today would mint a **new** Guid per POST. Chat stamps correlation only because it `BroadcastAsync(..., ConversationCorrelation)` on itself.

### Windowing / surface today

- `ISurface : IEntity<SurfaceState>` with `Open(SurfaceScene, cap)`. Default instance `"desk"`. Comments: Chart/Surface have **no** `[ClientEntryPoint]`; `Read()` is `IEntity<TState>`; writes are same-silo.
- `IChart : IEntity<ChartState>` with `Render` / `Append` (EventId de-dupe).
- `SurfaceBoot` (grain `surface-boot`) listens to the activation channel and `Send`s `OpenSurface` to `IUIRenderer` — another planted boot path, not `start.cs`.
- Flutter `windowing_screen.dart`: “Offline windowing playground — drag, resize, minimize, tidy. **No C# / edge.**”

### Pain

The owner cannot program “what calls what” from first activation. Studio’s default canvas is a lie held up by seed + `IChat`. New conversation = new chat grain that re-binds inbox and re-runs a turn machine, instead of a new correlation + empty transcript on the same Ino.

---

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

- On first `DigitalBrainActivated`, **after Chat is no longer the `UserMessaged` source**, `start.cs` writes the Bound synapse **inbox → Ino** (`UserMessaged`) using ordinary `SubscribeTo`. That synapse is durable. Restart does not replay composition. `start.cs` is `StartupScriptWorker` only — never an `IBehavior`.
- After boot, the **default canvas** shows Ino (and later, owner-wired non-infra neurons). Session, composer, turn worker, behaviors index, execution, surface-boot, uirenderer are not default-canvas citizens. Technical canvas may show composer and the Bound edge.
- UI injects `UserMessaged` into one owner-global composer/inbox, stamping the **stored workspace `CorrelationId`**. UI mounts entities. UI does not `BindOutgoing`, `SubscribeTo`, or seed neurons “so the graph looks right.”
- `IAssistant` `IHandle<UserMessaged>`. Handle accepts and journals (Deliver already journals incoming) and, **only after the Chat cutover**, enqueues the hidden worker. It never awaits the LLM. `IAgentKernel` is a **non-`INeuron`** grain so overlapping submits enqueue, not block.
- Workspace = stored `CorrelationId` + `ITranscript` entity + `ISurface` scenes on a **shared desk** with workspace-prefixed scene keys. Same Ino, same behaviors. New ChatGPT-like conversation = new workspace, not a new assistant.
- Message-chart dashboard: a behavior subscribed to inbox `UserMessaged` appends `IChart` and `ISurface.Open(...)`. Flutter windowing **reads** those entities, filtered by current workspace.
- Incremental, independently reviewable PRs with tests in the same PR. Do not start from leftover behaviors-kernel deletion (6b).

### Non-goals

- A second English runtime, JSON capability bus, or generated Orleans types per script.
- Making journals the chat history (512 entries / 512 KB — `JournalWindow`).
- Deleting `IBehavior` / scripting host / `BehaviorExecutionWorker`.
- Multi-Ino. One `IAssistant` instance `"assistant"` per owner.
- Redesigning OAuth / specialist continuation policy. Those stay; their *attachment point* moves off `IChat` in the cutover PR, and specialist tests move in that same PR.
- Replacing BroadcastChannel activation fan-out in this plan (SurfaceBoot peel is later).
- Changing journal broadcast-once semantics (already implemented in `SignalSender.BroadcastAsync`).
- Renaming `NeuronReference.PublishAsync` in the Chat cutover (separate follow-on).

## Honest inventory

### Already shipped (keep)

| Piece | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Broadcast journals **once**, then delivers along source synapses | `SignalSender.BroadcastAsync` | Empty audience still journals so SSE/debugger see the fact; no N outgoing copies |
| `Publish` on `IDigitalBrain` during a behavior run = that behavior’s broadcast | `IDigitalBrain.PublishAsync` | Throws outside a claimed execution |
| `IHandle<T>` is receive capability; synapse is who receives T from **this** source | `NeuronReferenceExtensions.SendAsync`, `SubscribeToAsync` | Compile-time gate; Ino **cannot** subscribe to `UserMessaged` until it `IHandle`s it |
| `ConversationId` on chat broadcasts | `Chat.ConversationCorrelation` | Activity **groups** by `CorrelationId`; it does **not** filter by `chatName` |
| `IUserMessages` + bind-on-chat-activate | `Chat.OnNeuronActivatedAsync` | Works, but Chat is the wrong source |
| MCP graph tools | `GraphTools.cs` | `kind: usermessages` is principal-prefixed today |
| Behaviors: draft/activate, out-of-silo handlers, durable subscribe | `BehaviorNeuron`, `BehaviorExecutionWorker` | Composition is not replayed on handler edit |
| Entities: Chart, Surface, Memory, Image, … | `IEntity<TState>.Read()`, ui HTTP | UI already mounts ui state |
| Session as client membrane | `IBrainNeuron` grain type `sessionneuron` | `isInfrastructure` + `studioCanvas` hide it |
| `IAgentKernel.AskStreaming` | **on the Assistant neuron** | In-silo stream; owners/scripts use `IAgent` + `RequestAsync` |

### Still fighting the model (this plan)

| Piece | Fight |
|---|---|
| Graph seed of chat + assistant + ownerRoot | Debugger activates `IChat` to have a root id |
| Walk rules skip inbox→Ino Bound | Source-owned edge; assistant is not private; startup `Subscribe` has null principal |
| `IChat` mini-app | Turn queue + transcript list + `AskStreaming` + user-action resume live on a canvas-shaped neuron |
| `Agent : IAgentKernel` | Streaming occupies Ino’s serialized turn |
| `IAssistant` cannot `IHandle<UserMessaged>` | Ino is only reachable by private RPC; AI.Contracts does not reference UI contracts |
| `start.cs` no-op | OS is empty; wiring is planted by Chat activate + projection |
| `GetReference` scopes IComposer/IAssistant | start.cs, HTTP, behaviors, MCP would hit three grains |
| No inject primitive with stored correlation | `Send` mints a new Guid; no name→Guid index |
| `NeuronReference.PublishAsync` = `SendAsync` | Misnomer; **not** part of the Chat cutover |
| Windowing offline | `windowing_screen.dart` does not `Read()` `ISurface` / `IChart` |
| `SurfaceBoot` plants Home | Second activation listener besides `start.cs` |
| Chat-owned `_transcript` | Duplicate of what should be an entity |
| Principal-partitioned `IUserMessages` `"default"` | Abandoned; not migrated |

---

## Proposed Design

### 1. Boot: `start.cs` is the OS (`StartupScriptWorker` only)

Keep the existing activation pipe. Change the payload of `start.cs` **in the Chat cutover PR, not before**.

```csharp
var ino = Brain.Get<IAssistant>("assistant");
var inbox = Brain.Get<IComposer>("inbox");
await ino.SubscribeToAsync<IComposer, UserMessaged>(inbox.Id);
return $"Wired Ino ← inbox for owner '{Brain.Owner.Value}'.";
```

`CSharpStartupScriptRunner` already references `typeof(IChart).Assembly` (UI contracts, same assembly as today’s `IUserMessages`) and imports `DigitalBrain.UI` and `DigitalBrain.Chat`. `IComposer` next to `IUserMessages` needs **no new runner reference**. The required API sugar is two-arg `SubscribeToAsync` on `NeuronReference<IAssistant>` (three-arg exists; C# will not infer `TSelf`).

**Idempotency:** `Subscribe` → target `HandleAsync(Subscribe)` → `BindOutgoing` on the source (`Neuron.cs`). Re-running after a `start.cs` hash change is a no-op bind. Do not put `Get<IChat>` or graph-seed logic in the script.

**What boot does *not* do:** create workspaces, open Home (until SurfaceBoot is peeled), subscribe behaviors, activate chat, or enqueue LLM work.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Aspire as ActivationHostedService
    participant Root as sessionneuron (hidden)
    participant Script as StartupScriptWorker
    participant Inbox as IComposer inbox
    participant Ino as IAssistant assistant

    Aspire->>Root: Activate()
    Root->>Root: RecordOutgoing DigitalBrainActivated (once)
    Root-->>Script: WatchJournalAsync outgoing
    Script->>Script: ledger miss (owner, signalId, sha256)
    Script->>Ino: Get IAssistant assistant (owner-global)
    Script->>Inbox: Get IComposer inbox (owner-global)
    Script->>Ino: SubscribeTo IComposer UserMessaged
    Ino->>Inbox: BindOutgoing(ino, UserMessaged)
    Note over Inbox,Ino: Bound synapse lives on inbox (source): inbox → Ino
    Note over Root: Default canvas: Ino only. Technical: may show inbox + Bound edge
```

This sequence is **cutover-only**. Until then `start.cs` stays a no-op so Chat’s broadcast cannot dual-fire Ino.

### 2. Naming: `IComposer`, instance `"inbox"`, grain type `usermessages`

**Decision: product name is `IComposer`. DigitalBrain identity is `[GrainType]`, not Orleans `[Alias]`.**

`NeuronId.For<T>` → `GrainTypeNames.Of` (`src/Kernel/DigitalBrain.Contracts/Identity/GrainTypeNames.cs`) reads a public const `GrainTypeName` on the contract (same pattern as `IBrainNeuron`), else **`[GrainType]`** (class-only; invalid on interfaces), else strips a leading `I`. It does **not** read `[Alias]`. `UserMessagesNeuron` is `[GrainType("usermessages")]`. Without `IComposer.GrainTypeName = "usermessages"`, `Brain.Get<IComposer>("inbox")` addresses **`composer:{owner}/inbox`**, a different empty grain.

```csharp
[Alias("usermessages")] // Orleans serializer/grain contract only
public interface IComposer : INeuron, IHandle<UserMessaged>
{
    const string DefaultInstanceName = "inbox";
    const string GrainTypeName = "usermessages"; // DigitalBrain NeuronId.For / GrainTypeNames.Of
}

// No [Alias], no [GrainType]. I-strip still yields "usermessages".
[Obsolete("Use IComposer.")]
public interface IUserMessages : IComposer;
```

**Exact id:** `NeuronId.For<IComposer>(owner, "inbox")` **must** be `new NeuronId("usermessages", owner, "inbox")` (`Type == "usermessages"`, `ToString()` `usermessages:{owner.Value}/inbox`). Same as `UserMessagesNeuron.Id` for that owner/name. PR-1 test asserts this; PR-2 id-equality uses `NeuronId.For<IComposer>`, not a hand-built `"composer"` string.

`UserMessagesNeuron` implements **`IComposer`** (`[GrainType("usermessages")]` on the class, matching the interface). MCP kind map: `usermessages` | `composer` → `brain.Get<IComposer>("inbox")` **without** `PrincipalPartition.InstanceName`.

**IHandle list (composer):**

| Signal | Why |
|---|---|
| `Subscribe` / `Unsubscribe` | `INeuron` — how Ino (and behaviors) write Bound edges on this source |
| `UserMessaged` | The only owner-typed injection. Handle **broadcasts** the same payload so subscribers fire |

**IHandle list (Ino / `IAssistant`):**

| Signal | Why |
|---|---|
| `Subscribe` / `Unsubscribe` | `INeuron` |
| `AgentRequest` | `IAgent` — scripts and specialists still `RequestAsync` |
| `UserMessaged` | **New.** Conversational fact from inbox |

Composer `HandleAsync(UserMessaged)` stays the current `UserMessagesNeuron` body: require a delivery, `BroadcastAsync(signal, cause)` so correlation rides the envelope. **Actor equality** (`signal.Actor?.PrincipalId == VerifiedActor.Current?.PrincipalId` when an HTTP actor is present) is added at cutover, with a test for mismatched `Actor`. Until cutover, Chat’s rebroadcast still flows through this Handle.

**One inbox per owner**, instance `"inbox"`. Chat’s principal-partitioned `"default"` is abandoned (not migrated).

### 3. Owner-global `Get` allowlist

`DigitalBrainClientTransport.GetReference` today unscopes only `IBehaviors`. **Allowlist owner-global (do not `ScopeName`):**

- `IBehaviors` (existing)
- `IComposer` (and obsolete `IUserMessages` if the type still exists)
- `IAssistant`

`GetEntity` stays principal-scoped when an actor/claim is present (transcript, surface, workspace index, charts).

MCP `GraphTools.Resolve`:

- `usermessages` / `composer` → `brain.Get<IComposer>("inbox")` **not** `Instance(name)`
- `assistant` → `brain.Get<IAssistant>("assistant")` **not** prefixed
- `chat` / `behavior` / `xaccount` keep `Instance(name)` until Chat dies

HTTP inject uses `brain.Get<IComposer>("inbox")` with the connection actor set — the allowlist is what keeps it owner-global.

**Simulation test (PR-2):** `start.cs` bind target id == HTTP send target id == behavior `Get<IComposer>("inbox").Id` (all `usermessages:inbox` for that owner). Same assertion for `IAssistant` `"assistant"`.

### 4. UI injection and workspace `CorrelationId`

Flutter / HTTP never call `BindOutgoing`.

**Inject primitive** (kernel helper, used by `POST /owner/commands` after cutover and by tests as soon as PR-2):

```csharp
public interface IWorkspaceInject
{
    Task<CommandId> InjectUserMessage(
        string workspaceName,
        string text,
        ActorContext actor,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

Algorithm:

1. Require `actor == HttpActor.Current` (HTTP). Refuse mismatched `Actor`.
2. `EnsureWorkspace(workspaceName)` on principal-scoped `IWorkspaceIndex`: if missing, **refuse** (unknown workspace). Exception: first-time `"main"` may be created with a new durable `Guid` so existing Flutter `chatName: main` keeps working.
3. Load stored `CorrelationId` for that name (never `CorrelationId.New()` per POST).
4. Build `UserMessaged(commandId, Chat: default, text, actor)` — `Chat` field unused; envelope correlation is authoritative.
5. `Deliver` to owner-global inbox a `SignalDelivery.Create(..., correlation: storedGuid)` from the session membrane (or `IBrainNeuron.Send` extended to accept `CorrelationId`). Composer `BroadcastAsync(signal, cause)` reuses `cause.CorrelationId`.

`INeuronGrain.SendFrom` does not take correlation today. **Do not** use plain `SendAsync(signal)` for inject — it mints a new Guid. Add an internal `Send(receiver, signal, CorrelationId)` on `IBrainNeuron` / session helper used only by `IWorkspaceInject`. Scripts keep typed `SendAsync` without correlation (new Guid or cause).

**`IWorkspaceIndex`** (entity, principal-scoped, **lands in PR-2**, before graph filter and before `ITranscript`):

```csharp
[Alias("ui.workspace-index")]
public interface IWorkspaceIndex : IEntity<WorkspaceIndexState>
{
    Task Ensure(string name, string title);
    Task<WorkspaceRecord?> Find(string name);
    Task<WorkspaceRecord?> FindByCorrelation(string correlationId);
}

public sealed record WorkspaceRecord(
    string Name,
    string CorrelationId,
    string Title,
    DateTimeOffset UpdatedAt);
```

`ITranscript` (PR-4) is keyed by **workspace name** (same principal-scoped entity name). Handle/worker looks up `FindByCorrelation(CurrentDelivery.CorrelationId)` then `GetEntity<ITranscript>(record.Name)`. Until PR-4, Chat’s durable list remains the UI store.

Graph `/chats/{chatName}/brain` (PR-2): `Find(chatName)` → stored workspace Guid. **Do not treat empty `CorrelationId` as topology** — `CorrelationId` ctor throws on `Guid.Empty`, and `SignalDelivery.Create` does `correlation ?? cause?.CorrelationId ?? CorrelationId.New()`, so `Subscribe`/binds carry a **random** Guid, not empty.

Activity include rule:

- **Always include** topology signal types: `Subscribe`, `Unsubscribe` (any correlation).
- **Workspace-scoped types** — `UserMessaged`, `Responded`, `TurnLifecycle`, `AgentActivity` — include only when `delivery.CorrelationId` **equals** the index Guid for `{chatName}`.
- Drop other workspaces’ scoped activity. If the name is unknown: Ino topology (synapses + Subscribe/Unsubscribe) and **no** scoped activity dump. Cap remains `MaxActivity = 64` **after** that filter.

### 5. Ino `Handle(UserMessaged)` and LLM offload

**Key Decision:** extract `IAgentKernel` onto a **non-`INeuron`** grain. Ino remains the `UserMessaged` handler (owner-visible). Streaming must not take Ino’s serialized turn.

Rejected mix: `Assistant : IAgentKernel` (today) + `IHandle<UserMessaged>` on that grain.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Flutter
    participant Inject as IWorkspaceInject
    participant Inbox as IComposer
    participant Ino as IAssistant neuron
    participant Worker as IAgentTurnWorker (not INeuron)
    participant Kernel as IAgentKernel grain (not INeuron)
    participant Tx as ITranscript (PR-4)

    UI->>Inject: InjectUserMessage(workspace, text, actor)
    Inject->>Inbox: Deliver UserMessaged (stored CorrelationId)
    Inbox->>Inbox: Broadcast once
    Inbox->>Ino: Deliver UserMessaged
    Note over Ino: Cutover+: enqueue and return. PR-1: journal incoming and return (no enqueue).
    Ino->>Worker: Enqueue(correlation, command, text)
    Ino-->>Inbox: Handle returns
    Worker->>Tx: Read bounded history
    Worker->>Kernel: AskStreaming(messages, correlation)
    Note over Kernel: Occupies kernel grain, not Ino. Overlapping UserMessaged enqueues on worker.
    Kernel-->>Worker: chunks
    Worker->>Ino: RecordTurnFact(Responded / TurnLifecycle, correlation)
    Worker->>Tx: Append assistant line
```

**PR-1 Handle (mandatory, no “or”):** accept + incoming journal (Deliver already did) + **return**. Tests: directed `composer.SendAsync(UserMessaged)` (or inject helper once PR-2 exists) → Ino incoming contains the signal; **no** `AskStreaming`; **no** `ChatTurnWorker.RunAsync`; **no** `start.cs` Subscribe. Product HTTP still `IChat.SendMessage`.

**Cutover `UserMessaged` Handle:** enqueue on `IAgentTurnWorker` and **return**. Never `Ask`, `AskStreaming`, or `AskDurablyAsync`.

**`IAgentKernel` extract (cutover PR, stacked commit before HTTP flip) — contract, not an “or”:**

1. **Grain identity:** `[GrainType("agent-kernel")]` (or `GrainId.Create("agent-kernel", ...)`). **Not** `assistant`. `ChatTurnWorker.DefaultResponder` and tests use `GrainId.Create("agent-kernel", $"{owner.Value}/assistant")` (or an `IAgentKernel.For(OwnerId)` helper). **Forbidden:** `GetGrain<IAgentKernel>(NeuronId.For<IAssistant>(owner, "assistant").ToGrainId())` — that GrainId type is `assistant` and still activates Ino.
2. **Kernel holds** `IChatClient` and the `Ask` / `AskStreaming` loop (token stream + tool iterations). It is **not** `Neuron` / `INeuron` and has no synapses.
3. **Tool / delegation / observation loop lives on the kernel grain’s stream, but every graph effect is a short RPC to Ino:** `PrepareTools`, existing `SendAsync`/`RequestAsync` to specialists (`TurnRequests` today requires `Agent` as source — keep that on Ino), `RecordTurnFact` for `AgentActivity`. A non-neuron kernel must not `Send` as if it were Ino. Durable `AskDurablyAsync` / `_completedRequests` **stays on Ino** (short RPC to read/write); no silent dictionary migration.
4. **`UserMessaged` Handle never awaits the kernel.** Conversational path: Handle → `IAgentTurnWorker.Enqueue` → worker calls kernel `AskStreaming`. Overlapping `UserMessaged` while a stream is in flight **enqueues** on the worker; Ino Handle returns.
5. **`AgentRequest` Handle does await kernel `Ask` then `ReplyAsync`.** Directed `RequestAsync` must complete in `HandleAsync`. That occupies Ino for specialist/script asks only. It is an **accepted exception**, not an escape hatch for chat. Do not write “or replies after kernel Ask” as if `UserMessaged` could wait.

`Agent` **stops implementing** `IAgentKernel`. Review gate: overlapping `UserMessaged` during **AskStreaming** enqueues; a test must submit a second `UserMessaged` while a stream is in flight and see Handle return plus queue depth ≥ 1.

**`IAgentTurnWorker` (not `INeuron`, not seeded, not discovered):**

- Evolved from `ChatTurnWorker` but **not** `ForChat` / not `IChatKernel.LoadTranscript` after cutover.
- Keyed by `(owner, correlationId)`.
- Owns: turn queue, cancel, `WaitingForUser`, `CompleteUserAction`.
- **In-silo surface HTTP talks to after peel:**

| Verb | Grain | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Inject `UserMessaged` | `IWorkspaceInject` → `IComposer` | Correlation stamped |
| Cancel turn | `IAgentTurnWorker.Cancel` | Not `IChat.Handle(CancelTurn)` |
| Complete user action / login resume | `IAgentTurnWorker.CompleteUserAction` | `AgentTurnContext` carries workspace name + `CorrelationId`, **not** `IChat` id. `SpecialistContinuationTests` move in this PR |
| Record `Responded` / `TurnLifecycle` / screened `AgentActivity` | `IAssistantTurn.RecordTurnFact` on **Ino** | Short serialized turn; worker calls this after kernel chunks / lifecycle. SSE watches Ino outgoing |
| SSE live tokens | Watch Ino outgoing + inbox outgoing, filter correlation | Do **not** ship HTTP inject without `Responded` already appearing on Ino outgoing |

`IChatTurnWorker.RunAsync` **cannot** be used “without Chat” in PR-1. It loads `IChatKernel`, `SetActiveExecution`, `AgentTurnContext.Chat`. Do not pretend otherwise.

**Latency:** Ino Handle stays milliseconds (journal + enqueue). LLM remains `NeuronCallTimeouts.LongRunning` on the kernel grain.

### 6. Conversational signals vs AI.Contracts

`DigitalBrain.Modules.AI.Contracts.csproj` references only `DigitalBrain.Contracts`. UI.Contracts already references Product.Contracts. Product.Contracts must not reference UI.Contracts (cycle).

**PR-1 moves only `UserMessaged`.** Keep `[Alias("chat.user-messaged")]` and `[Id(0..3)]` field layout (`CommandId`, `NeuronId Chat`, `string Text`, `ActorContext? Actor`). A changed Alias orphans journals.

| Type | Stays | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `UserMessaged` | **Move** to `DigitalBrain.Product.Contracts` | Only type `IAssistant : IHandle<>` needs. `CommandId` / `NeuronId` / `ActorContext` already Product/Abstractions |
| `Responded` | **UI.Contracts** | References `UiCardOffer` (`DigitalBrain.UI`). Cannot enter Product without a cycle |
| `TurnLifecycle` | **UI.Contracts** | `ChatTurnStatus`, `TurnId`, `NeuronId Chat` are Chat/UI types |
| `UiCardOffer`, `ChatTurnStatus` | **UI.Contracts** | Ui / turn machine |

`IAssistantTurn.RecordTurnFact(Signal fact, CorrelationId correlation)` takes Abstractions `Signal`. The **worker** (UI module) constructs `Responded` / `TurnLifecycle`; Ino’s grain implementation `RecordOutgoingAsync(fact, correlation)` without AI.Contracts referencing UI. If `Responded` must become product-level later, split the card payload out first — not in this series.

Rejected: `IAssistantConversation` in the UI module — `SubscribeToAsync` on `NeuronReference<IAssistant>` requires `IAssistant : IHandle<UserMessaged>` on the contract scripts compile against. Rejected: AI.Contracts → UI.Contracts. Rejected: moving `Responded`/`TurnLifecycle` in PR-1.

### 7. Graph is a debugger

Seed set (owner 2026-09-06):

- **Never seed** `IChat`, Ino, or session as canvas citizens. Opening Studio does **not** `ReadActiveExecutionAsync(chat)`.
- **Peek (hidden infra):** `IComposer` `"inbox"` and the owner session. Walk Bound targets from the inbox even when source/target are not principal-private. Session outgoing `DigitalBrainActivated` (null principal) is visible activity; Flutter default canvas keeps that event when the session node is hidden.
- **Discover:** saved `IBehavior` ids (library until enabled/invoked), then BFS from peeked inbox/session and those behaviors.
- **Ino appears only after composition** (inbox Bound edge, typically `start.cs` at cutover or a test bind). Empty inbox → empty default canvas.
- **Replacement for “Running”:** Ino outgoing `AgentActivity` once Ino is discovered. Execution grains remain discoverable from that delegation; no chat-keyed read.

**Exact `isInfrastructure` types after PR-2:**

| Grain type | Today | After |
|---|---|---|
| `chat-turn-worker` | yes | yes |
| `sessionneuron` | yes | yes |
| `behaviors` | yes | yes |
| `execution` | yes | yes |
| `usermessages` (composer) | no | **yes** |
| `surface-boot` | no | **yes** |
| `uirenderer` | no | **yes** |
| `assistant` | no | no (default canvas) |
| `chat` | no | n/a (not seeded; if leftover, treat as infra until deleted) |

`RootId` = `assistant:assistant` (logical; the node is absent until composition).

**Default canvas (`studioCanvas`, technical false):** non-infra, non-library nodes (Ino once bound; enabled behaviors). Empty after a clean boot. **Hiding composer means the Bound inbox→Ino edge is not on the default canvas**. Technical canvas shows composer, session, leftover chat, and those edges. Do not invent a presentation-only fake edge.

PR-2 tests must update `behavior_studio_test.dart` node id lists (today expects `assistant:assistant` on default canvas from a fixture that still includes `chat:main` and `sessionneuron:session`) **and** C# `BrainGraphProjectionTests`.

### 8. Workspace = view, not a new Ino

| Part | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Topic | stored `CorrelationId` on the delivery envelope | Index maps name ↔ Guid |
| Transcript | `ITranscript : IEntity<TranscriptState>` (PR-4) | Bounded UI store; **not** a neuron; **not** the traffic journal |
| Surface | existing `ISurface` **shared `"desk"`** | Scene keys **include workspace name**: `{kind}:{workspace}:{local}` e.g. `chart:main:my-messages`. Windowing filters scenes by current workspace prefix |
| Ino | same `IAssistant` `"assistant"` | Behaviors subscribe to inbox, not to a chat grain |

New conversation: `IWorkspaceIndex.Ensure` new name + new Guid; empty `ITranscript`; **`start.cs` is not replayed.**

`ITranscript` (PR-4):

```csharp
[Alias("ui.transcript")]
public interface ITranscript : IEntity<TranscriptState>
{
    const int DefaultCap = 500;
    Task Append(TranscriptEntry entry, int cap);
}
```

Journals stay the debugger. Flutter history after PR-4 = `Read()` the entity; live tokens SSE from Ino outgoing. No entity journals.

**Subscribe is first-class per workspace (owner 2026-09-05).** A Bound synapse is `(source, signalType, correlation)`. `Subscribe`/`Unsubscribe` carry an optional `CorrelationId` (`null` = every workspace). Broadcast delivers to synapses whose correlation is `null` **or** equals the envelope Guid. `start.cs` uses `SubscribeToAsync<IComposer, UserMessaged>(inbox.Id, workspace)` for Ino on `"main"`; a dashboard that should see every topic omits the Guid. New conversation: `Ensure` + subscribe the behaviors that should hear that topic (Ino for chat; plotter only if the owner asked). Not a C# `if` inside a global handler.

### 9. Dashboard + windowing

Owner-programmed behavior (not planted by projection):

```csharp
var workspace = "main"; // or from CurrentDelivery / index
var chart = Brain.GetEntity<IChart>($"{workspace}-my-messages");
await chart.Render(new ChartState("Messages I sent", "line", Array.Empty<ChartPoint>()));
await Brain.GetEntity<ISurface>("desk").Open(
    new SurfaceScene($"chart:{workspace}:my-messages", "Messages I sent"),
    cap: 8);
```

Flutter `WindowingScreen` drops `PanelManager.seedDemoPanels()`. It `Read()`s `ISurface` `"desk"` via `GET /ui/surfaces/{name}`, keeps scenes whose key contains `:{currentWorkspace}:`, mounts `chart:*` via `onReadChart`. Drag/resize/minimize stay client chrome.

Windowing does **not** depend on `ITranscript`. Ui surface GET can follow PR-2 in parallel with transcript work.

### 10. What happens to `IChat`

| Phase | `IChat` role |
|---|---|
| PR-1 | Unchanged product orchestrator. Ino Handle is no-op. `start.cs` still no-op |
| PR-2 | Still product path. Graph no longer seeds/activates it |
| PR-3 cutover | HTTP/SSE leave Chat. Bind/broadcast removed. `start.cs` Subscribe. Worker + kernel extracted. `IChat` may remain a dead grain until deleted |
| PR-4 | Copy-forward `_transcript` → `ITranscript("main")` if non-empty; then drop Chat lists |

MCP `ChatTools` `RequestAsync(SendMessage)` switch to `IWorkspaceInject` at cutover.

---

## Worked examples

### 1. Fresh boot — only Ino on the default canvas

See §1 sequence (**after cutover**).

- Neurons: `sessionneuron:session` (infra), `assistant:assistant` (canvas), `usermessages:inbox` (infra, discovered via Ino incoming Subscribe), `surface-boot:default` if still channel-subscribed (infra).
- Synapse: inbox → Ino, `UserMessaged`, Bound.
- Default canvas: **Ino only**. Technical: Ino + inbox + Bound edge (+ session if the walk discovers it; session is not seeded).
- No `IChat` activated by the projection.

### 2. Owner types a message (after cutover)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Flutter -->|InjectUserMessage main| Idx[IWorkspaceIndex]
    Idx -->|stored Guid W| Inbox[IComposer inbox]
    Inbox -->|Broadcast once| Ino[IAssistant]
    Inbox --> Beh[IBehavior optional]
    Ino -->|Enqueue| Worker[IAgentTurnWorker]
    Worker -->|AskStreaming| Kernel[IAgentKernel not INeuron]
    Worker -->|RecordTurnFact| Ino
    Ino -->|Responded correlation W| SSE[SSE / graph]
    Worker -->|Append PR-4| Tx[ITranscript main]
```

Graph `/chats/main/brain` shows correlations **only** for Guid W plus topology events.

### 3. Dashboard — message chart + windowing

1. Behavior `SubscribeTo<IComposer, UserMessaged>(inbox.Id)` with **no** correlation (every workspace), `Open(SurfaceScene("chart:main:my-messages", ...))`.
2. Default canvas: Ino + enabled behavior (inbox edge **technical-only**).
3. Windowing `Read()` desk, keep `chart:main:*` for workspace `main`.

### 4. New workspace / topic

`Ensure("taxes")` → new Guid, empty transcript. Subscribe Ino (and any asked behaviors) with that correlation; `start.cs` is not replayed. Inject stamps the new Guid. Desk scenes for `taxes` start empty; `main` scenes remain but windowing filters them out.

---

## API / Interface Changes

### `IAssistant`

```csharp
[Alias("DigitalBrain.AI.IAssistant")]
public interface IAssistant : IAgent, IHandle<UserMessaged>;
```

Requires `UserMessaged` on Product.Contracts (see §6).

### In-silo turn surface (cutover)

```csharp
public interface IAssistantTurn : IGrainWithStringKey
{
    Task RecordTurnFact(Signal fact, CorrelationId correlation, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}

public interface IAgentTurnWorker : IGrainWithStringKey
{
    Task Enqueue(CorrelationId correlation, CommandId command, string text, ActorContext actor, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task Cancel(CommandId command, TurnId turn, ActorContext actor, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task CompleteUserAction(AgentTurnContext context, string actionId, bool accepted, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

`IAssistantTurn` is implemented by the Assistant **neuron** (short turns). `fact` is Abstractions `Signal` so the UI worker can pass `Responded` without AI.Contracts referencing UI. `IAgentTurnWorker` and `IAgentKernel` (`agent-kernel`) are **not** neurons.

### Subscribe sugar

```csharp
public static Task SubscribeToAsync<TSource, TSignal>(
    this NeuronReference<IAssistant> ino,
    NeuronId source,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    where TSource : INeuron
    where TSignal : Signal
    => NeuronReferenceExtensions.SubscribeToAsync<IAssistant, TSource, TSignal>(ino, source, cancellationToken);
```

### HTTP

| Today | After cutover |
|---|---|
| `POST /owner/commands` `chat.send` → `IChat.RequestAsync(SendMessage)` | `IWorkspaceInject.InjectUserMessage` |
| `GET /chats/{chatName}/events` watches `IChat` outgoing | Inbox + **Ino** outgoing, filter stored correlation for `{chatName}` |
| `GET /chats/{chatName}/brain` seeds `IChat` | Seed Ino; discover inbox; filter activity by index Guid |
| no surface ui read | `GET /ui/surfaces/{name}` → `ISurface.Read()` (windowing PR) |
| `GET /ui/charts/{chartName}` | Unchanged |

`NeuronReference.PublishAsync` stays Send until a **follow-on contracts PR** after cutover. `IDigitalBrain.PublishAsync` remains behavior-only Broadcast.

---

## Data Model Changes

| Store | Change | Migration |
|---|---|---|
| Inbox synapses | Bound `UserMessaged` → Ino written by `start.cs` **at cutover** | Idempotent bind. Chat’s old chat→principal-`default` binds abandoned |
| `IWorkspaceIndex` | New entity, principal-scoped | PR-2; Ensure `"main"` on first inject/graph read |
| `ITranscript` | New entity, principal-scoped, name = workspace name | PR-4; copy-forward Chat `_transcript` for `"main"` if non-empty |
| `IAgentKernel` grain | New non-neuron grain | Cutover extract; ChatTurnWorker retarget before HTTP flip |
| `IAgentTurnWorker` | New non-neuron grain | Cutover; not `ForChat` |
| Grain type `usermessages` | Keep; instance `"inbox"` | Do not dual-write `"default"` |
| `NeuronReference.PublishAsync` | Unchanged in this series | Follow-on |

No Orleans schema codegen per script.

---

## Alternatives Considered

### A. Keep `IChat` as the inbox (reject)

Keeps the mini-app on the canvas and a new chat grain per conversation.

### B. New Ino per conversation (reject)

Breaks durable behaviors and “same Ino.”

### C. Ino `Handle` awaits `AskStreaming` on the neuron turn (reject)

Freezes Ino for the whole LLM + tool loop.

### C2. Hidden worker is the `UserMessaged` handler; Ino stays `IHandle<AgentRequest>` only (reject)

Would avoid extracting `IAgentKernel`, but the owner-visible contract would not be `IAssistant : IHandle<UserMessaged>`, and `start.cs` `ino.SubscribeToAsync<IComposer, UserMessaged>` would not compile. **Chosen instead: extract `IAgentKernel` off Ino; Ino handles `UserMessaged`.**

### D. Core chat loop as an `IBehavior` (reject)

OS would depend on draft/activate and the scripting host for the first token.

### E. Keep the name `IUserMessages` (reject for product language; cheap for MCP)

Owner language is composer/inbox. Grain type/alias stays `usermessages`. Obsolete `IUserMessages` without a second `[Alias]`.

### F. Seed the graph from `start.cs` by activating chat (reject)

### G. `start.cs` Subscribe in PR-1 while Chat still broadcasts (reject)

Dual LLM attempts. Subscribe only in the Chat cutover.

### H. PR-1 calls `ChatTurnWorker.RunAsync` without Chat (reject)

Worker is a `Neuron` keyed by chat name and loads `IChatKernel`.

### I. AI.Contracts → UI.Contracts for `UserMessaged` (reject)

Move signals to Product.Contracts.

### J. Shared desk vs `GetEntity<ISurface>(workspaceName)` (shared desk chosen)

Scene keys include workspace name; windowing filters. Avoids N surface entities for chrome that is one desk.

## Security & Privacy Considerations

| Threat | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| UI/HTTP `BindOutgoing` | High | HTTP only `IWorkspaceInject` / entity GET. Graph `SetSubscriptionAsync` still rebuilds scope and checks `IHandle` |
| Cross-principal inject into owner-global inbox | High | Inject helper: `Actor` must equal `HttpActor.Current`. Cutover: composer Handle refuses mismatched `Actor` when `VerifiedActor` is present (test). Index/transcript/surface/chart names stay `ScopeName` under HTTP (`MapUiEntities` pattern) |
| Wrong grain (`{principal}.inbox`) | High | GetReference allowlist + MCP must not prefix inbox/assistant. Simulation id equality test |
| LLM offload as a hidden graph backdoor | Medium | Kernel and worker are not `INeuron`; no synapses; correlation required; `AgentActivity` / `Responded` recorded on **Ino** |
| Transcript leakage | Medium | Ui HTTP `IEntity.Read()` + principal-scoped entity names. Graph `Summarize(UserMessaged)` is character count only. There is no `[ClientEntryPoint]` attribute in this tree |
| Startup script as RCE | Existing | Host-shipped `start.cs`, same `ScriptOptions` allowlist. Owner programs `IBehavior`s, not the OS file |

Session neuron remains the authenticated client membrane. Never a default-canvas citizen.

---

## Observability

- **Logs:** `StartupScriptWorker` success/fail with owner, activation signal id, script sha256. Prefer the `Subscribe` journal on Ino incoming over a custom “wired” log.
- **Metrics:** `UserMessaged` tallies on composer outgoing; Ino `AgentActivity` started/completed/failed; worker queue depth (optional).
- **Alerts:** after cutover, boot smoke **must** assert Bound synapse `usermessages:inbox --UserMessaged--> assistant:assistant`. Today a no-op `start.cs` “succeeds” and hides a missing scripting host.
- **Graph:** filter by workspace Guid then cap 64. Do not project kernel/worker grain ids.

---

## Rollout Plan

1. **No additive `start.cs` Subscribe.** Product path stays Chat until the cutover PR. PR-1 Handle cannot enqueue.
2. Each PR green on CI (simulation + touched E2E + Flutter if UI).
3. Cutover PR is one reviewable PR with **stacked commits**: (a) extract `IAgentKernel`, ChatTurnWorker retarget; (b) extract `IAgentTurnWorker` + `RecordTurnFact` while Chat still calls the worker; (c) flip HTTP/SSE, remove Chat bind/broadcast, `start.cs` Subscribe, Ino Handle enqueues, specialist tests retarget. Revert the whole PR on failure.
4. `ITranscript` copy-forward is forward-only; unused entities are harmless on rollback.
5. Operator: ship new `start.cs` **with** the cutover silo. Ledger: new hash runs on scripting-host restart against historical `DigitalBrainActivated`.

---

## Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Dual `UserMessaged` → two LLM attempts | Critical | `start.cs` Subscribe and Ino enqueue only in cutover commit (c), same PR as Chat bind/broadcast removal |
| `AskStreaming` on Ino turn / Handle blocked by stream | Critical | Extract `IAgentKernel` off `Neuron`; gate: overlapping `UserMessaged` enqueues |
| `Get` / MCP prefix `inbox` | Critical | Allowlist + MCP resolve + id-equality test |
| Inject mints a new Guid | High | `IWorkspaceInject` only; refuse unknown workspaces except Ensure `"main"` |
| Graph cannot see inbox→Ino | High | Discover from Ino incoming Subscribe even when not private |
| HTTP inject without `Responded` on Ino | High | Cutover does not flip HTTP before `RecordTurnFact` |
| `IChatTurnWorker` used in PR-1 | High | Forbidden |
| Duplicate `[Alias("usermessages")]` | Medium | Alias only on `IComposer` |
| `IComposer` without `GrainTypeName = "usermessages"` | Critical | `NeuronId.For` would be type `composer`; PR-1 asserts `.Type == "usermessages"` |
| Awaiting kernel Ask on `UserMessaged` Handle | Critical | Forbidden; only `AgentRequest` Handle awaits `Ask` |
| Empty `CorrelationId` as topology marker | Medium | Filter by signal type; `CorrelationId` rejects empty Guid |
| Login continuation still uses `AgentTurnContext.Chat` | Medium | Same PR as cutover |
| Abandoned `usermessages:{principal}/default` | Low | Document; do not migrate |

---

## Key Decisions

1. **`start.cs` is the OS and is `StartupScriptWorker` only** — never an `IBehavior`. Graph projection and Chat activation must not plant conversational wiring. SurfaceBoot Home-open stays until a follow-on after windowing.
2. **`IComposer` is the UI injection neuron.** Put **`const GrainTypeName = "usermessages"`** on `IComposer` (what `GrainTypeNames.Of` / `NeuronId.For` honor; Orleans `[GrainType]` is class-only) **and** `[Alias("usermessages")]` for Orleans. Exact id: `NeuronId.For<IComposer>(owner, "inbox").Type == "usermessages"`. Instance `"inbox"`; **one per owner**. `IUserMessages` is obsolete **without** a duplicate Alias or GrainType. Do not rely on `[Alias]` for DigitalBrain identity.
3. **`IAssistant : IAgent, IHandle<UserMessaged>`.** Move **only** `UserMessaged` to `DigitalBrain.Product.Contracts` (keep Alias `chat.user-messaged` and field ids). `Responded` / `TurnLifecycle` / `UiCardOffer` stay in UI.Contracts. AI.Contracts references Product.Contracts, not UI.Contracts. `RecordTurnFact` takes `Signal`.
4. **Extract `IAgentKernel` to grain type `agent-kernel` (not `assistant`, not `INeuron`).** Conversational `UserMessaged` Handle **never awaits** Ask/AskStreaming; it only enqueues `IAgentTurnWorker`. The tool/delegation loop runs inside kernel `AskStreaming`, with **short RPCs to Ino** for PrepareTools, Send/Request, and `RecordTurnFact`. `AgentRequest` Handle **does** await kernel `Ask` then `ReplyAsync` (directed RPC exception). Overlapping `UserMessaged` during AskStreaming **enqueues**. Durable `_completedRequests` stays on Ino.
5. **PR-1 Handle is accept + journal + return.** No enqueue, no `ChatTurnWorker`, no `start.cs` Subscribe.
6. **`start.cs` Subscribe happens in the same production switch that cuts Chat bind/broadcast and HTTP.** One LLM attempt per owner submit.
7. **`GetReference` allowlists `IComposer` and `IAssistant` as owner-global** (with `IBehaviors`). MCP must not principal-prefix `inbox` / `assistant`. Test: `NeuronId.For<IComposer>(owner,"inbox").Type == "usermessages"` and that id == HTTP send id == behavior `Get` id.
8. **`IWorkspaceInject` stamps the stored workspace Guid.** `IWorkspaceIndex` lands with unscoped Get and graph filter (PR-2), before `ITranscript`. Unknown workspace refused; `"main"` may be Ensure’d. Graph activity: always include `Subscribe`/`Unsubscribe`; filter `UserMessaged`/`Responded`/`TurnLifecycle`/`AgentActivity` by that Guid. **Never** use empty `CorrelationId` as a topology marker (`CorrelationId` rejects `Guid.Empty`; deliveries mint a Guid).
9. **Graph seed = Ino only.** Discover inbox from Ino incoming `Subscribe` even when not private; composer is observed infrastructure. Default canvas will **not** show the Bound edge. Replace `ReadActiveExecutionAsync(chat)` with Ino `AgentActivity` status. Exact infra list: existing four plus `usermessages`, `surface-boot`, `uirenderer`. Flutter `behavior_studio_test.dart` updates in the same PR.
10. **Transcript is an entity** (`ITranscript`), ~500 entries, keyed by workspace name, after cutover. Journals stay 512/512KB.
11. **Workspace = stored correlation + transcript + shared `"desk"` with `{kind}:{workspace}:{local}` scene keys.** Windowing filters by current workspace. Same Ino. New conversation does not replay `start.cs`.
12. **HTTP `/chats/{name}` stays** as the workspace alias for one release.
13. **`NeuronReference.PublishAsync` rename is a follow-on**, not the Chat cutover.
14. **Do not start from behaviors-kernel deletion.**

---

## PR Plan

Independently reviewable. Tests in the **same** PR. Production dual-path is forbidden.

### PR-1 — Contracts + Ino Handle no-op

- **Title:** `IComposer` + `IAssistant : IHandle<UserMessaged>` (accept and journal only)
- **Files / components:**
  - Move **only** `UserMessaged` to `DigitalBrain.Product.Contracts`; keep `[Alias("chat.user-messaged")]` and `[Id]` layout. Leave `Responded` / `TurnLifecycle` in UI.Contracts
  - `IAssistant.cs`; `Assistant.HandleAsync(UserMessaged)` returns after argument checks (incoming already journaled)
  - `IComposer` in UI contracts: **`const GrainTypeName = "usermessages"`** and `[Alias("usermessages")]`; grain implements `IComposer`; obsolete `IUserMessages` without Alias/GrainType
  - `NeuronReference<IAssistant>.SubscribeToAsync<TSource, TSignal>` sugar (used by tests; `start.cs` **unchanged no-op**)
  - Tests: `NeuronId.For<IComposer>(owner, "inbox").Type == "usermessages"` and equals `UserMessagesNeuron` id; directed composer `SendAsync(UserMessaged)` (test host may `SubscribeTo` Ino **in the test**, not via `start.cs`) → Ino incoming; Handle did not call `IChatClient` / `AskStreaming` / `ChatTurnWorker`; `CSharpStartupScriptRunnerTests` still run the **no-op** script; compile a snippet of the future `start.cs` against runner options in a test that does **not** execute Subscribe against a live Chat-wired host
- **Depends on:** nothing
- **Description:** Product HTTP still `IChat`. **Forbidden:** `start.cs` Subscribe, enqueue, `RunAsync`.

### PR-2 — Owner-global Get, workspace index, Ino-only graph with discovery

- **Title:** Unscoped inbox/Ino + correlation inject helper + graph observes Ino
- **Files / components:**
  - `DigitalBrainClientTransport.GetReference` allowlist
  - `GraphTools.Resolve` for `composer`/`usermessages`/`assistant` without `Instance()`
  - `IWorkspaceIndex` + `IWorkspaceInject` (Deliver with stored Guid). HTTP **not** flipped yet; tests call the helper
  - **First-class workspace Subscribe:** `Subscribe`/`Unsubscribe` optional `CorrelationId`; `Synapse` stores it; `SignalRouter.BroadcastRecipientsFor` matches envelope correlation or `null` (any). `SubscribeToAsync(..., CorrelationId?)`. Tests: Ino subscribed to `"main"` does not receive `"review"`; a `null` subscription receives both.
  - `BrainGraphProjection`: **do not seed** chat/Ino/session; peek inbox+session as infra; walk inbox Bound targets even when not private; leftover `chat` is infra; drop `ReadActiveExecutionAsync(chat)`; `RootId` = assistant (logical); workspace activity filter stays with inject/index when that lands
  - Tests: `NeuronId.For<IComposer>(owner,"inbox").Type == "usermessages"` and that id == inject target == behavior Get; unknown workspace → topology (`Subscribe`/`Unsubscribe`) without foreign `UserMessaged`/`AgentActivity`; `BrainGraphProjectionTests`; Flutter `behavior_studio_test.dart` (and any `studioCanvas` fixtures)
- **Depends on:** PR-1 (Ino can `IHandle` so a test may bind; production `start.cs` still no-op)
- **Description:** Default canvas is empty until composition (inbox Bound → Ino, or an enabled behavior). Technical canvas shows inbox/session. Production `start.cs` still no-op Subscribe until cutover.

### PR-3 — Extract streaming + cut Chat + `start.cs` Subscribe (one switch)

- **Title:** One LLM path: kernel off Ino, inject to inbox, OS wiring
- **Stacked commits (one PR):**
  1. Extract `IAgentKernel` to grain type **`agent-kernel`** (not `assistant`); `Agent` stops implementing it; `DefaultResponder` uses `GrainId.Create("agent-kernel", ...)` never `IAssistant.ToGrainId()`. Kernel owns Ask/AskStreaming + tool loop; each tool/delegation/observation is a short RPC to Ino. `UserMessaged` Handle still no-op (no enqueue yet). `AgentRequest` Handle awaits kernel `Ask` then `ReplyAsync`. Test: Chat `SendMessage` still one stream on `agent-kernel`; probe `UserMessaged` Handle during stream returns (Ino not blocked by streaming).
  2. Extract `IAgentTurnWorker`; `RecordTurnFact` on Ino; Chat product path **calls the worker** (still one LLM). `AgentTurnContext` gains workspace/correlation; specialist tests compile against the new context **in this PR**.
  3. Flip: `MapOwnerCommands` / `ChatTurnStream` / `OwnerSessionJournal` / MCP `ChatTools` → `IWorkspaceInject` + SSE on Ino+inbox; remove `Chat.BindOutgoing` and `Broadcast UserMessaged`; Ino `UserMessaged` Handle **enqueues and returns** (never awaits kernel); `start.cs` Subscribe; boot smoke asserts Bound synapse `usermessages:…/inbox`. Test: one `AskStreaming` per submit; overlapping submit enqueues; mismatched Actor rejected.
- **Depends on:** PR-1, PR-2
- **Description:** Atomic for the dual-fire invariant. **Out of this PR:** `PublishAsync` rename, `ITranscript`, windowing.

### PR-4 — `ITranscript` + copy-forward

- **Title:** Transcript entity is the UI store
- **Files / components:** `ITranscript`, entity, ui read if Flutter history should not parse journals; copy-forward Chat list for `"main"`; Flutter history `Read()`; tests: new workspace empty transcript, synapse count unchanged, `start.cs` not replayed
- **Depends on:** PR-3
- **Description:** Worker Append on enqueue/Responded.

### PR-5 — Windowing reads `ISurface` / `IChart` (parallel with PR-4)

- **Title:** Windowing mounts live Surface scenes
- **Files / components:** `windowing_screen.dart`; `MapUiEntities` + `HttpSurfacePaths` surface GET; scene filter `{kind}:{workspace}:`; `workspace_test.dart`
- **Depends on:** PR-2 (index + ui pattern). **Does not depend on** PR-4
- **Description:** Client chrome stays Flutter-only.

### Follow-on (not this series)

- `NeuronReference.PublishAsync` = source Broadcast; list every call site
- SurfaceBoot Home-open → `start.cs` after windowing
- HTTP `/chats` → `/workspaces`
- Behaviors kernel deletion (6b)
- Entity watch/SSE

---

## Open Questions

1. **SurfaceBoot Home-open** — **Resolved (owner 2026-09-05):** move into `start.cs` as a **follow-on after PR-5**, not in this series. Leave the activation-channel neuron until windowing reads `ISurface`.
2. **Subscribe-per-workspace** — **Resolved (owner 2026-09-05):** first-class synapse `(source, signal, correlation)` in this series (PR-2 with inject/index). `null` correlation = all workspaces.
3. **Multi-principal owner brains** — **Resolved (owner 2026-09-05):** not in this series. One owner-global inbox.

## Revision Summary

Addressed review 2026-09-05 (issues 1–17): no dual-fire in PR-1; extract `IAgentKernel` off Ino; owner-global Get allowlist; `IWorkspaceInject` + index in PR-2; graph discovers inbox from Ino incoming Subscribe; PR reorder; Product.Contracts for `UserMessaged`; single `[Alias("usermessages")]`; `RecordTurnFact` / worker HTTP table; shared desk scene keys; exact `isInfrastructure` list.

**Second pass (GrainType / Responded cycle / kernel await / correlation filter):**

- `IComposer.GrainTypeName == "usermessages"`; `NeuronId.For<IComposer>(owner,"inbox").Type == "usermessages"` (Alias is not DigitalBrain identity). `GrainTypeNames.Of` reads that const (Orleans `[GrainType]` cannot be on interfaces).
- Move only `UserMessaged` (keep `chat.user-messaged`); `Responded`/`TurnLifecycle` stay in UI.Contracts (`UiCardOffer` cycle).
- Kernel grain type `agent-kernel`, never `IAssistant.ToGrainId()`. `UserMessaged` Handle never awaits Ask/AskStreaming; tool loop on kernel with short RPCs to Ino. `AgentRequest` Handle awaits `Ask` then `ReplyAsync`.
- Graph filter by signal type, not empty `CorrelationId`.
