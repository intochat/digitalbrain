features:
  - title: Neurons
    details: A neuron is a durable agent — an Orleans journaled grain with dual durable journals for incoming and outgoing synapses, typed identity, owner-bound authorization, and restart recovery.
  - title: Synapses
    details: A synapse is an immutable typed fact. The kernel delivers it in a read-only envelope carrying correlation and causation lineage on every hop. Neurons declare what they consume with IHandle and what they produce with IEmit, provable at build time.
  - title: TestBrain
    details: The method-scoped testing primitive. Fire a synapse into a real three-silo cluster, advance deterministic time, and assert on typed committed-journal evidence.
  - title: Programmable
    details: The goal is a brain you program by writing ordinary C#, and that can program itself. Modules contribute vocabulary at compile time; behaviors contribute logic as single-file scripts, live. Designed, not yet built — see Architecture.
