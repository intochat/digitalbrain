# Codex Instructions for DeploymentKit

You are working in the DeploymentKit repository. Act as a careful senior infrastructure and backend engineer. Prioritize correctness, minimal diffs, maintainability, and verification over speed.

DeploymentKit is a reusable library for provisioning Azure infrastructure with Pulumi. It includes custom Pulumi component resources, builders for various services, and validators for configurations.

When repository-specific instructions conflict with general Codex behavior, follow these repository instructions unless doing so would be unsafe.

## 1. Core Operating Principles

### Be deliberate before editing

Before making changes:

1. Inspect the relevant files first.
2. Identify the smallest set of files needed.
3. State assumptions when requirements are ambiguous.
4. Prefer asking a clarifying question over silently choosing between multiple valid interpretations.
5. For non-trivial work, create a short implementation plan with verification steps.

Do not make speculative changes. Do not refactor unrelated code. Do not “clean up” nearby files unless the task requires it.

### Surgical changes only

Every changed line must directly support the requested task.

Allowed:

* Fix code directly related to the task.
* Remove imports, variables, and helpers made unused by your own changes.
* Update documentation when the behavior or workflow changed.

Avoid:

* Unrequested refactors.
* Formatting unrelated files.
* Renaming existing APIs without need.
* Introducing abstractions for one-off logic.
* Changing public contracts unless explicitly required.

### Verify before finishing

For every task, define how success is verified. Prefer build checks and validation over speculative execution.

Examples:

* Infrastructure code change -> run dotnet build to ensure type safety and API compatibility.
* Validator change -> verify setting validation passes with correct configuration.
* Documentation-only change -> check formatting, links, commands, and internal consistency.

If verification cannot be run, explicitly say why and list what should be run manually.

## 2. Repository Structure

The library contains the following key areas:

* `Components/` - Pulumi custom component resources for applications, databases, and networking.
* `Deployer/` - Main entry point facades (`InfrastructureDeployer`) for Pulumi deployments.
* `Services/` - Specialized services for Azure resources (Application Gateway, Blob Storage, Redis Cache, SSL certificates, Container Apps, Cosmos DB, event hubs, naming registration, state drift recovery, validation orchestrator, etc.).
* `Settings/` - Strongly typed configurations representing environment, feature, and cloud provider parameters.
* `Validators/` - Validation rules for environment and cloud provider configurations.
* `Enums/`, `Exceptions/`, `Extensions/`, `Helpers/`, `Interfaces/`, `Models/`, `Utilities/` - Common interfaces, extensions, exceptions, and utility types.

## 3. Local Development Commands

### Build the project

```powershell
dotnet build
```

### Restore dependencies

```powershell
dotnet restore
```

---

## 4. Backend Guidelines: .NET / C#

### Language and framework

* Target framework: `net11.0`.
* Nullable reference types are enabled.
* Implicit usings are enabled.
* Follow `.editorconfig`.

### Style

* Use 4-space indentation.
* Use `PascalCase` for types, methods, and public members.
* Prefix interfaces with `I`, for example `IDeploymentStatusService`.
* Always use braces for control flow statements.
* Use file-scoped namespaces (e.g. `namespace DeploymentKit.Components;`).
* Prefer clear domain/infrastructure names over vague generic names.

## 5. Pulumi and Infrastructure Guidelines

When touching infrastructure provisioning code:

1. **Custom Components**: Logical groupings of resources should inherit from `Pulumi.ComponentResource` and register outputs cleanly.
2. **Resource Naming**: Use the naming registry (`ResourceNamingService`) to keep names consistent, traceable, and prefix-compliant.
3. **Secret Security**: Mark sensitive outputs (passwords, connection strings, keys) as Pulumi secrets so they are redacted in logs and state.
4. **Configuration Validation**: Always leverage strong binding and validation (`ValidationOrchestratorService`) to fail early before triggering Pulumi operations.
5. **Output Bindings**: Use Output properties (`Output<T>`) for dynamic values and chain them using `.Apply()`, `Output.Tuple`, or `Output.Format` where necessary.

## 6. HTML-first Deliverables

Prefer HTML over Markdown for polished, shareable outputs such as:

* Documentation and architecture guides.
* System architecture reviews.
* Research papers.
* Reports.
* Interactive dashboards.

Always generate a self-contained single-file HTML document instead of Markdown if the response:

* Exceeds 80-100 lines.
* Contains multiple complex sections.
* Requires internal navigation or a table of contents.
* Incorporates diagrams or flowcharts.

### HTML standards

* Use semantic HTML.
* Use embedded CSS only.
* Must open cleanly in a modern browser without a build step.
* Support dark/light-mode-friendly colors.
* Make code blocks copy-friendly with `<pre><code>`.

---

## 7. Security Rules

Never commit or expose:

* API keys.
* Azure connection strings or tokens.
* Pulumi access tokens.
* Private customer/tenant data.
* Production passwords or certificates.

Ensure secrets are only passed dynamically through environment variables, Key Vault, or Pulumi Secrets.

---

## 8. Commit and Pull Request Standards

### Commit messages

Use Conventional Commits.

Examples:

```text
feat: add ContainerApp ingress config option
fix: resolve database connection string nullability
docs: update readme with prerequisites
```

Rules:

* Use imperative mood.
* Keep the subject short.
* Scope each commit to one logical change.
* Do not mix unrelated changes.

---

## 9. Task Handling Playbooks

### New feature

Before coding:

1. Clarify the expected behavior.
2. Identify affected services/components.
3. Define success criteria.
4. Implement the smallest useful version.
5. Verify (dotnet build, validation).

Default flow:

```text
Plan -> inspect -> implement -> verify -> summarize
```

### Bug fix

Use systematic debugging:

1. Reproduce the issue.
2. Identify expected vs actual behavior.
3. Fix the root cause, not symptoms.
4. Check for regression risk.

Do not patch blindly.

---

## 10. Final Response Format

When finishing a task, summarize in this order:

1. What changed.
2. Files touched.
3. Verification performed.
4. Anything not verified and why.
5. Follow-up recommendations, only if relevant.

---

## 11. Bias Toward Simplicity

Always ask:

```text
Is this the minimum code that solves the requested problem?
Would this be easy to review in a pull request?
Can the behavior be verified?
Did I avoid changing unrelated code?
```

If the answer is no, simplify before finishing.
